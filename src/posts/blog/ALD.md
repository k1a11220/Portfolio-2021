## Summary

In the ALD process, wafer can't move to another space. Because wafers can be polluted by gas or particles. But if wafer can move to another space without pollution, process productivity will increase. So, our team developed this equipment prototype to prove our theory.

## Goal

- Wafer transporting in process
- Rotating chamber
- Vaccum sealing with magnetic fluid

## The Challenge

There were two challenges that we have to solve.

First, **'How to rotate chamber'**. Second, **'Sealing chamber in rotating process'**.

## Design

### Gear and motors

To rotate the chamber, our team determined to use a servo motor and internal gears. So we calculated the gear ratio by those formulas. Based on the result data we selected internal gears and servo motor type.

### Sealing with O-ring & Magnetic fluid

O-ring design was not difficult. But we spent a lot of time to think magnetic fluid.

It's not recommended to use an o-ring with moving parts. Because o-ring makes particles by friction. Particles bring the critical issue to the wafer.

So we have to find material that meet two criteria.
**1. Don't make any particles**
**2. Vacuum sealing during rotating chamber.**

Finally we found magnetic fluid with magnet.

## Final Solution

By understanding this process, we designed the final solution.

## Manufacturing

We considered using four type of process.

1. MCT
2. CNC Lathe
3. Wire Cutter
4. Welding

So we Optimized design for manufacturing machine.

## Reflection

We found two critical issues with this solution. First, magnetic fluid was ineffective for sealing. Second, a wafer can be affected by the magnet.

So we had to redesigning equipment without magnetic fluid.
