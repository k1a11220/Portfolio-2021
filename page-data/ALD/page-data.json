Second, <strong>'Sealing chamber in rotating process'</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Design</h2>\n<h3>Gear and motors</h3>\n<p>To rotate the chamber, our team determined to use a servo motor and internal gears. So we calculated the gear ratio by those formulas. Based on the result data we selected internal gears and servo motor type.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ItvEDDR.png\" alt=\"https://i.imgur.com/ItvEDDR.png\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ndH1BGy.jpg\" alt=\"https://i.imgur.com/ndH1BGy.jpg\"></p>\n<h3>Sealing with O-ring &#x26; Magnetic fluid</h3>\n<p>O-ring design was not difficult. But we spent a lot of time to think magnetic fluid.</p>\n<p>It's not recommended to use an o-ring with moving parts. Because o-ring makes particles by friction. Particles bring the critical issue to the wafer.</p>\n<p>So we have to find material that meet two criteria.\n<strong>1. Don't make any particles</strong>\n<strong>2. Vacuum sealing during rotating chamber.</strong></p>\n<p>Finally we found magnetic fluid with magnet.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fdtsbIw.png\" alt=\"https://i.imgur.com/fdtsbIw.png\"></p>\n<h2>Final Solution</h2>\n<p>By understanding this process, we designed the final solution.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qXSVH8A.png\" alt=\"https://i.imgur.com/qXSVH8A.png\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/d8qkZih.jpg\" alt=\"https://i.imgur.com/d8qkZih.jpg\"></p>\n<h2>Manufacturing</h2>\n<p>We considered using four type of process.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>MCT</li>\n<li>CNC Lathe</li>\n<li>Wire Cutter</li>\n<li>Welding</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So we Optimized design for manufacturing machine.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/E0B7RR3.jpg\" alt=\"https://i.imgur.com/E0B7RR3.jpg\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/O5r1fuA.jpg\" alt=\"https://i.imgur.com/O5r1fuA.jpg\"></p>\n<h2>Reflection</h2>\n<p>We found two critical issues with this solution. First, magnetic fluid was ineffective for sealing. Second, a wafer can be affected by the magnet.</p>\n<p>So we had to redesigning equipment without magnetic fluid.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"ALD equipments","desc":"In the ALD process, wafer can't move to another space.
